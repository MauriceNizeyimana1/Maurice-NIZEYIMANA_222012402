    <h1>DATABASE AND JAVA LABOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>

	<ol><h2><u><li>DATABASE</li></u></h2>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The database of a labor management system typically includes comprehensive information about employees, their schedules, attendance records, payroll details, and possibly performance evaluations. It may also store data on available shifts, job roles, and organizational structures. Additionally, it could include historical data for analysis and forecasting purposes. The database structure is designed to efficiently manage and retrieve this information to facilitate workforce management tasks such as scheduling, payroll processing, and performance tracking.</p>

		<ul type="square"><h3><u><i><li>Tables</li></i></u></h3>
    
	     <li><b>Attendance Table</b></li>

			  <p>Attendance Table:This entity tracks the presence or absence of employees during scheduled work hours. It typically includes timestamps for when an employee clocks in and out, as well as any breaks taken during the workday. Recording attendance accurately is vital for calculating payroll, monitoring employee punctuality, and ensuring compliance with labor laws and company policies.</p></br>

			<li><b>Benefit Table</b></li>

				<p>Benefit Table:The benefit entity encompasses various perks and privileges provided to employees by their employer. This can include health insurance, retirement plans, vacation days, sick leave, and other forms of compensation beyond the base salary. Managing benefits within an LMS involves tracking eligibility, enrollment, usage, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.</p></br>

			<li><b>Employee Table</b></li>

				<p>Employee Table:The employee entity represents individuals who are part of the workforce within the organization. It contains essential information about each employee, such as their personal details, job role, department, contact information, and employment history. Effective management of employee data facilitates tasks like payroll processing, performance evaluations, and resource allocation.</p></br>

			<li><b>Leave_Request Table</b></li>

				<p>Leave_Request Table:This entity manages the process of employees requesting time off from work for various reasons, such as vacation, illness, or personal matters. Leave requests typically include details such as the requested dates, type of leave (e.g., paid or unpaid), reason for the absence, and any supporting documentation. Automating the leave request process within an LMS streamlines approvals, ensures staffing coverage, and maintains accurate leave balances for employees.</p></br>

			<li><b>Payroll Table</b></li>

				<p>Payroll Table:The payroll entity encompasses the calculation and distribution of employee compensation, including wages, salaries, bonuses, and deductions. It involves processing attendance records, calculating hours worked, applying appropriate pay rates, and deducting taxes and other withholdings. Integrating payroll functionality into an LMS enables seamless synchronization of attendance data and ensures timely and accurate payment to employees.</p></br>

			<li><b>Performance Table</b></li>

				<p>Performance Table:This involves tracking, evaluating, and improving employee performance. LMS systems often include tools for setting performance goals, conducting performance reviews, and providing feedback to employees. Performance data collected within the system helps identify areas for improvement and informs decisions related to promotions, rewards, or disciplinary actions.s</p></br>

			<li><b>Training Table</b></li>

				<p>Training Table:This aspect focuses on planning, delivering, and tracking employee training programs. LMS platforms facilitate the creation and management of training materials, courses, and curricula. They also provide features for scheduling training sessions, monitoring attendance, and assessing training effectiveness. By centralizing training activities within the system, organizations can ensure that employees receive the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their jobs effectively.</p></br>

<li><p><b>Eclipse IDE:</b></li> an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development, and was the most popular. </p><br>

<li><p><b>JAR stands for Java Archive:</b></li>  It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating many files into one. Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and their requisite components.<br></p>
